    "Q1. What are the common built-in data types in Python?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Q2. What is slicing in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Slicing is used to access parts of sequences like lists, tuples, and strings.\n",
    "     The syntax of slicing is-[start:end:step].\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are Keywords in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Keywords in python are reserved words that have special meaning.They are generally used to define type of variables.\n",
    "     Keywords cannot be used for variable or function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Memory is managed in Python in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Memory management in python is managed by Python private heap space. \n",
    "       All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. \n",
    "       The programmer does not have access to this private heap. The python interpreter takes care of this instead.\n",
    "    2. The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager.\n",
    "       The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.\n",
    "    3. Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory \n",
    "       and so that it can be made available to the heap space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is namespace in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A namespace is a naming system used to make sure that names are unique to avoid naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What are python modules? Name some commonly used built-in modules in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Python modules are files containing Python code. This code can either be functions classes or variables. \n",
    "     A Python module is a .py file containing executable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the commonly used built-in modules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. os\n",
    "    2. sys\n",
    "    3. math\n",
    "    4. random\n",
    "    5. data time\n",
    "    6. JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What are local variables and global variables in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Global Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Variables declared outside a function or in global space are called global variables.\n",
    "        These variables can be accessed by any function in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Local Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Any variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable.\n",
    "        This variable is present in the local space and not in the global space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Is python case sensitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Yes. Python is a case sensitive language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What is type conversion in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Type conversion refers to the conversion of one data type into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "int() – converts any data type into integer type\n",
    "\n",
    "float() – converts any data type into float type\n",
    "\n",
    "ord() – converts characters into integer\n",
    "\n",
    "hex() – converts integers to hexadecimal\n",
    "\n",
    "oct() – converts integer to octal\n",
    "\n",
    "tuple() – This function is used to convert to a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "set() – This function returns the type after converting to set.\n",
    "\n",
    "list() – This function is used to convert any data type to a list type.\n",
    "\n",
    "dict() – This function is used to convert a tuple of order (key, value) into a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "str() – Used to convert integer into a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "complex(real,imag) – This function converts real numbers to complex(real,imag) number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Indentation is necessary for Python. It specifies a block of code. \n",
    "     All code within loops, classes, functions, etc is specified within an indented block. \n",
    "     It is usually done using four space characters. If your code is not indented necessarily, \n",
    "     it will not execute accurately and will throw errors as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is the difference between Python Arrays and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Arrays and lists, in Python, have the same way of storing data. \n",
    "     But, arrays can hold only a single data type elements whereas lists can hold any data type elements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q12. What are functions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called. \n",
    "     To define a Python function, the def keyword is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. What is __init__?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: __init__ is a method or constructor in Python. \n",
    "     This method is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/ instance of a class is created.\n",
    "     All classes have the __init__ method.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q14. What is a lambda function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: An anonymous function is known as a lambda function. \n",
    "     This function can have any number of parameters but, can have just one statement.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q15. How does break, continue and pass work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Break:\n",
    "            Allows loop termination when some condition is met and the control is transferred to the next statement.\n",
    "     Continue:\n",
    "            Allows skipping some part of a loop when some specific condition is met and the control is \n",
    "            transferred to the beginning of the loop\n",
    "     Pass:\n",
    "            Used when you need some block of code syntactically, but you want to skip its execution. \n",
    "            This is basically a null operation. Nothing happens when this is executed.\n",
    "Q16. What does [::-1} do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: [::-1] is used to reverse the order of an array or a sequence. \n",
    "                \n",
    "Q17. What are python iterators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Iterators are objects which can be traversed though or iterated upon.\n",
    "                \n",
    "Q18 What are the generators in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Functions that return an iterable set of items are called generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19. How will you capitalize the first letter of string?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python, the capitalize() method capitalizes the first letter of a string. \n",
    "     If the string already consists of a capital letter at the beginning, then, it returns the original string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q20. How will you convert a string to all lowercase?\n",
